// pause_message and end_message are special variables that will get directly interpreted by FreeExp as the message displayed between exps, and at the end of the exps
// An empty lines must separate the variable declaration and the experiments, as well as every experiment after the first one.
// Comments can be added by starting the line with // (These line won't be interpreted by FreeExp)

//keywords : (case doesn't matter)
// -> Display x y (with speed z): FreeExp will display x element from the y variable.
//                              : You can define the speed (in ms on screen). If not defined, default is 1000ms
// -> separated by x y (with speed z): Optional, will put x objects from y between the primary objects displayed.
//
//NOTE : If the elements of the list end with ".jpg", they will be intepreted as images automatically, and loaded.
//NOTE 2 : You can only use "=" in the variables lines, as they are used to intepret them as variable lines !
