// You can define variables anywhere using variable_name = content (You can't have spaces in the name of the variables !)
// Spaces around punctuations do not matter, they are only there for ease of reading (ie "a, b" is interpreted the same as "a,b" or "a , b" or even "a    ,b")
// pause_message and end_message are special variables that will get directly interpreted by FreeExp as the message displayed between exps, and at the end of the exps
// An empty lines must separate the variable declaration and the experiments, as well as every experiment after the first one.
// Comments can be added by starting the line with // (These line won't be interpreted by FreeExp)

pause_message = Go to next exp ?
end_message = End of the experiments

//This is the description of an experiment.
Display 2 images with speed 300 separated by 4 random words with speed 300.

//keywords : (case doesn't matter)
// -> display x (random) y (with speed z): FreeExp will display x element from the y variable.
//                                         You can define the speed (in ms on screen). If not defined, default is 1000ms
//                                         You can also add the "random" keyword, which will display y in random order
// -> separated by x (random) y (with speed z): Optional, will put x objects from y between the primary objects displayed.
//
//NOTE : If the elements of the list end with ".jpg", they will be intepreted as images automatically, and loaded.
//NOTE 2 : You can only use "=" in the variables lines, as they are used to intepret them as variable lines !

//You can only display stuff :
Display 2 words

//And set their timings : (Note: if you try to display more elements than the list contains, it will loop over itself)
Display 4 images with speed 200

//You can use elements from another list to separate the elements displayed :
Display 5 words with speed 200 separated by 2 images with speed 400

//You can chain the "separated by" statements if you want :
Display 2 words separated by 2 images with speed 200 separated by 1 words_again with speed 300

//You can do multi-steps experiments as well (there won't be a pause between these) :
Display 2 words with speed 200
Display 4 images with speed 400
//Note : if you use the same list of words/images twice, it will start from the beginning again.

//You can also use commands:
Display 4 images with speed 400 separated by 2 words with speed 400. Use blanks with speed 100.

//List of the commands available for use :
//  -> use blanks (with speed x): will create blanks of length x ms between each display
